1. Django floows MVT Architecture
	-> User login to the webPage enters some address in search bar and when he click the enter button, the request will be forward
		to the view (preparation layer)
	-> if there is any data request to the URL then view will request the data from the model(database layer) and get the data
	-> After that the dynamic data should be send from view to the template(Presentation layer) to show the data.
	-> if the view wants static data then there is no need of going to the model, we can directly show in the template from the view
	-> view is nothing but a function. when we need dynamic data then only calls the model

2. Core components
	1. Models (database layer)
		-> Represent the data schema of the application
		-> define the structure of the data including fields and thier types
		-> django ORM automatically handles database interactions
	2. Templates (presentation layer)
		-> Control how data is presented to the user
		-> using django template language to create html files with dynamic content
	3. Views (preparation layer)
		-> handles the logic of your application
		-> process user requests, interact with models and return responses to the user
		-> if the user authenticated then it redirects to the dashboard otherwise it redirects to the login page
		-> we have two different views
			-> class based views
			-> function based views
	4. urls
		-> URL dispatcher maps urls to views
		-> allows for clean and readable urls
		-> to manage the all urls we will use urls.py file

3. basic workflow
	1. create a project
		-> use `django-admin startproject <project_name>` to setup a new project
	2. create an app
		-> use `python manage.py startapp <app_name>` to add a new application to the project
	3. define models
		-> create models in `models.py` for db structure
	4. create view
		-> define views in `view.py` to handle requests
	5. configure urls
		-> map urls to view in `urls.py`
	6. create templates
		-> develop html templates for the front-end in the `templates` directory
	7. admin configuration
		-> register models with the admin interface in `admin.py`

4. key commands
	-> `python manage.py runserver <port_number>` : start the development server
	-> `python manage.py makemigrations` : create a new migrations based on model changes
	-> `python manage.py migrate` : apply migrations to the database
	-> `python manage.py createsuperuser` : create a superuser account for the admin interface
