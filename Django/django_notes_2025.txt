what is django ?
--------------------------
-> django is open source and most popular python fw that is used to develop a fast, scalable and secure web applications
-> fw is collection of sw modules and tools to reduce the developing time
-> django provides registena and login functionality by default
-> we need to store the passwords in encrypted formates, it will automatically stores the passwordds
	 in PBKDF2 algorithm(password based key derivation function 2) with SHA 256 hashing technique to store the passwords.
-> django comes with default admin panel, we can do almost all types of crud operations without coding
-> highly scalable

why use django ?
------------------
-> clear, simple, reliable, fast, secure, flexible,scalable
-> huge community support and contribuntion
-> youtube, instagram, 
-> built in user admin panel, fully featured web interface automatcally generated
-> we can do easily do crud operations on admin panel
-> django follows DRY principle (don't repeat yourself) principle.  

commands to learn
------------------
1. python3 --version
2. pip3 --version
3. python3 -m venv env
4. pip3 install django
5. python3 -m pip freeze
6. django-admin startproject mysite .
	-> used to create django project where last dot will tell to create 
		django project at root level.
7. python3 manage.py runserver
	-> run the project
8. python3 manage.py startapp employees
	-> used to create new app
9. python3 manage.py migrate 
	-> used to create all the required default tables in admin panel
10. python3 manage.py createsuperuser
	-> used to create super user for login to the admin panel

django project structure
--------------------------
1. mysite is project directory
2. manage.py
	-> it is command line utility in django projects
	-> t serves as the primary interface for interacting with your Django project and performing various administrative tasks
	-> never edit this file until you are expert
	-> we can use this file to execute so many commands
3. mysite
	1. __init__.py
		-> we can ignore this file, it is empty file while creating project
		-> before we get to know about the purpose of the file, we should know about python packages
		-> package is collection of modules(functions, classes, variables)
		-> Don't delete this file, if we delete , we can't import modules/functions from one package to another package
		-> importing functionality will be easy with this file
	2. wsgi.py
		-> it stands for web server gatewat interface.
		-> it is used for deploying our application in production server(apache or nginx).
		-> it can be thought of as a specification how servers should interact with web applications
	3. asgi.py
		-> it is similar with wsgi.py, it has extra functionalities
		-> it is stands for asynchronous server gateway interface
	4. urls.py
		-> universal resource locater
		-> it can contain end points of webpages, images etc.,
	5. settings.py
		-> it is most important file in django project
		-> it will add the all the configurations for our django project
		-> it will come with some basic settings
		1. BASE_DIR
			-> it will get the root directory dynamically
			-> project name
		2. SECRET_KEY
			-> secret key used to generates the hashes for encrypt the data
			-> it should
		3. DEBUG
			-> it is set as true in development server
			-> in production it will be false
			-> we don't want to show any warning or errors or sample code or urls to the viewers 
		4. ALLOWED_HOSTS
			-> used to allow the devices addresses
		5. INSTALLED_APPS
			-> we should register the apps in this list
		6. MIDDLEWARE
		7. ROOT_URLCONF
			-> it will show urls.py path from the root folder
		8. TEMPLATES
			-> this configuration used to rendering the frontend templates
			-> we will add folder of bundle html templates in the DIR folder
		9. WSGI_APPLICATION
			-> it have server configuration
		10. DATABASES
			-> it have db connections
		11. AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS
			-> builtin password validators, used to check the strength of the passwords
		12. STATIC_URL
			-> image files, css files, js files are static files
		13. DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD
			-> primary key


How Django Works ?
-------------------
-> Django follows MVT Design Pattern
-> Model View Template
-> the design patterns are the way of defining the rules of developing software applications.
-> Model 
	-> it is reponsible for each and every DB operations
	-> it will be in server side
	-> Interact with DB
	-> model is the bridge between view and DB
-> Template
	-> seen by the users
-> View
	-> acts as bridge between modela and template
	-> recieves a request and returns a response
Example:
-> Let rohit requested to check his profile , now url pattern will come to urls.py and 
	in that it will match the requested url in path tuple and execure the corresponding views.method
-> the method will have logic to get the profile details from the DB, view itself cannot connect to the DB directly,
	so it will contact the model, the model will have db related logic
-> the model will give the data to the view and then view will give the data to the template which is seen by user.


URLs and HTTP Responses

BOOTSTRAP INTEGRATION
---------------------


DJANGO STATIC FILES
-------------------
-> if we have multiple folders in that static folder, we have one command called 'collectStatic', it will collect all the folders and place in the static_root. it mainly used in while deployment.

DJANGO APPS
-----------
-> it is python package specifically meant for using in a django project
-> python3 manage.py startapp employees
	-> used to create new app
-> In django project we will have multiple apps
-> app directory structure
	1. __init__.py
		-> if we see this, it means it is not simple folder, it is python packaage
		-> don't delete this file
	2. admin.py
		-> used to display the models in the django admin panel
		-> we can customize this
	3. apps.py
		-> this file is created to help the user to add application leve config
		-> you should have entire django idea then only , you can edit this file
	4. models.py
		-> contains essentials fields and behaviours of the data that storing in the db.
		-> we will create DB tables and class by writing the models in this file.
	5. tests.py
		-> used to run any test in the project
	6. views.py
		-> we will write our bussiness logic in this file

DJANGO ADMIN PANEL
------------------
-> to access the admin panel, we need to create a superuser by stopping the server and running the command
	'python3 manage.py createsuperuser'
